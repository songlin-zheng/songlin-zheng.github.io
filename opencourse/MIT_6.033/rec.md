## The Rise of Worse is Better
MIT/Stanford style of design:
- Must be *Correct* and *Consistent*.
- Must be *simple*. More important for the interface to be simple than the implementation.
- Must be as *complete* as possible. Simplicity isn't allowed to overly reduce completeness.

Worse-Is-Better philosophy: slightly different from above
- *Simplicity* is the most important consideration in a design.
- Must be *correct*. Slightly less important than *simplicity*.
- Must not be *overly inconsistent*. Can be sacrificed for simplicity.
	- Better to drop parts that deal with uncommon circumstances than to break simplicity or consistency.
	- Can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained. Especially worthless is consistency of interface.
- Must be as *complete* as possible. Can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality.
