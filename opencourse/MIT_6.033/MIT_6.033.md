Notebook: **Principles of Computer System Design: An Introduction**

Primary objective of 6.033:
- Evaluate and critique existing systems.
- Apply the technical material to new system components.
	1. How common design patterns are used to limit complexity.
	2. How operating systems use virtualization and abstraction to enforce modularity.
	3. How the Internet is designed to deal with scale, a diversity of applications and competing economic interests.
	4. How reliable usable distributed systems are able to be built on top of an unreliable network.
	5. Common pitfalls in the security of computer systems, and how to combat them.

Course Structure
- Lecutre: means what it means
- Recitation: talk about a particular paper in systems. Get a better sense of how communication in the field is done.
- Writing, design projects
